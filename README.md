THE TOBY BOOTSTRAP



INCLUDING TOBY CORE

Bootstrap and core are separated into two repositories so that you can start building your project from the bootstrap and update the core easily by pulling it from the repository.

Clone the core by navigating to this directory in the Terminal and then execute »git clone https://github.com/Tbstr/toby.git«.
