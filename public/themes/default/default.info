#  Here you can set links to local and external stylesheets and javascripts. You can set
#  them on a global scope as well as for certain controllers and actions. Place the global
#  ones on top and mark the queried section with [] braces as in the follofing example:
#
#  stylesheets[all][] = http://www.link.to/external/file.css
#  stylesheets[print][] = css/localstyleforprint.css
#  
#  javascripts[] = js/localscript.js
#
#  
#  [index/home]
#  
#  javascripts[] = js/scriptonlyforindexhome.js
#

# The version query will be appended to the link paths to controll caching without renaming
# the files. Increase or change this value if you have updates.
