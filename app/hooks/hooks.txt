Files in here help to fire code on certain events while the application core is running.


Available hooks:

pre_init.hook.php           - fires before core init
configs_loaded.hook.php     - fires after config files are red & interpreted
post_init.hook.php          - fires after core init
resolved.hook.php           - fires after successful resolve (after action run)
